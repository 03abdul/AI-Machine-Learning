# 🧮 02 – Math Basics for AI & ML

You **don’t need to be a math expert** to learn AI/ML.
But you do need **some basic math** to understand how it works.

We’ll focus on 3 main areas:

1. **Linear Algebra**
2. **Probability & Statistics**
3. **Calculus (just the idea)**

Let’s go step by step 👇

---

## 1️⃣ Linear Algebra – Math of Numbers, Rows, and Columns

This is the math used to **store and work with data**.

### 🧱 Basic Terms:

* **Scalar** → Just one number (e.g. `5`)
* **Vector** → A list of numbers (e.g. `[2, 5, 8]`)
* **Matrix** → A table of numbers

### 📦 Why It’s Useful:

* Data in AI/ML is stored in vectors and matrices.
* Images, text, numbers — all are **turned into numbers** and stored like this.

👉 Example:
A black & white image is stored as a **matrix of numbers** (each number = brightness of a pixel).

## 2️⃣ Probability & Statistics – Working with Uncertainty

In real life, **nothing is 100% sure**.
We use **probability** to deal with **chances** and **guessing**.

### 🎲 Probability:

* Tells us how **likely** something is to happen.
* Example: Flipping a coin → Heads has a 50% chance.

👉 In ML, we ask:

( 0 to 1 will be the probability value. 0.1 to 0.5 is wrong and 0.6 - 1.00 is correct.)
* What’s the **chance** this email is spam? - eg : This email is 58% probability to be spam. So Email is spam ( 0.58 * 100 ) = 58%
* What’s the **probability** the customer will buy? eg : The customer is 45% probability to buy the product. So The customer will not buy the product

### 📊 Statistics:

* Helps us **understand data** (average, max, min, etc.)
* Two common ideas:

  * **Mean (average)** – Add all numbers, divide by how many.
  * **Standard Deviation** – Tells how **spread out** the data is.

## 3️⃣ Calculus – The Idea of Change (Don’t worry, no hard math)

You only need to know **why calculus is used**, not how to do it.

### 🔄 Why Calculus?

* Machine Learning models try to **learn and improve** by reducing **errors**.
* They use calculus to:

  * **Find the best answer**
  * **Make small changes** to get better

👉 Example:

* You try different answers.
* You use calculus to **see which direction improves your model**.
* This is called **"gradient descent"** (fancy name, easy idea).

## 💡 Real-Life Examples:

| Math Concept     | Real-Life Example                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vector           | Your marks in 5 subjects: `[80, 72, 90, 65, 88]`         |
| Matrix           | A table of prices for 3 products in 4 months             |
| Probability      | What’s the chance of rain today?                         |
| Mean             | Average temperature this week                            |
| Gradient Descent | Slowly finding the best solution by trying and improving |

## ✅ Summary

| Concept         | Why it Matters in ML                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Linear Algebra  | For storing and working with data   |
| Probability     | For guessing and making predictions |
| Statistics      | For understanding data              |
| Calculus (idea) | For improving models                |

You **don’t need to solve big math problems** — just understand **how the ideas help**.
