## 🧠 What is AI and ML?

### 🤖 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

* **AI** means **making computers think and act like humans**.
* It’s like teaching a computer to be "smart" — to make decisions, solve problems, or understand things just like people do.

👉 Example:
When you talk to **Alexa**, use **Google Maps**, or see **YouTube video suggestions**, AI is working in the background.

### 📊 What is Machine Learning (ML)?

* **ML** is a part of AI.
* It helps computers to learn **patterns from data** and make **predictions without being explicitly programmed**.

**Patterns** - Patterns are relationships in the data that the model can learn and use this relationship to make prediction.

👉 Example:
If you show a computer( Ml model or Ml algorithm ) **many pictures of cats**, and tell it “this is a cat”, it will **automatically find patterns what cats look like** 
( i.e.,) common across most of the cat images like,
* Body Outline
* Eye Spacing
* Face Shape etc..,
Using patterns the model predicts when you give it a new picture, it can say, “Yes, this looks like a cat!” — That’s ML.

## 🔍 Difference between AI and ML

| AI (Artificial Intelligence)          | ML (Machine Learning)                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Big idea – make computers smart       | Small part of AI – learn from data                            |
| Can include rules, logic, or learning | Always uses data to learn                                     |
| Example: A robot playing chess        | Example: Predicting who will win the game based on past games |

## 🧠 Types of Machine Learning

There are 3 main types:

1. **Supervised Learning** 🧑‍🏫

   * You give the computer **examples with answers**. Examples - Cat image, Answers - "Cat" text. Image with label So, it is also called **Labeled data**
   * It learns from those examples.

   👉 Example: Show pictures of animals with labels (“cat”, “dog”). The computer learns to recognize them.

2. **Unsupervised Learning** 🕵️‍♂️

   * You give the computer **data without answers**. Only Image no label so it finds hidden patterns and group them. It is also called **Unlabeled data**
   * It finds **patterns or groups** by itself.

   👉 Example: Give a bunch of customer data, and the computer groups similar customers together. Like grouping by salary, experience etc..,

3. **Reinforcement Learning** 🎮

   * The computer **learns by trying**, like playing a game.
   * It gets **rewards for good actions**, and learns to do better.

   👉 Example: A robot learns to walk by trying, falling, and slowly improving.

## 🧠 Why Learn AI & ML?

* It's **used everywhere** — phones, websites, cars, hospitals, factories.
* It can help **solve real-world problems** like:

  * Predicting diseases
  * Helping students learn better
  * Making smart tools and apps

## 🧰 Real-Life Examples

| Task              | Where AI/ML is used |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Video suggestions | YouTube             |
| Voice assistants  | Alexa, Siri         |
| Face unlock       | Mobile phones       |
| Fraud detection   | Banks               |
| Self-driving cars | Tesla               |

## ✅ Summary

* **AI** = Smart computer behavior
* **ML** = Learning from data (a part of AI)
* AI is like a **big brain**; ML is how it **learns**
